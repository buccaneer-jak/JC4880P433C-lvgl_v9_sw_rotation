This example utilises a Guition 4.3-inch screen, model number: JC4880P433C
Please use the Arduino ESP32 version 3.2.1.

#lvgl v9.2.2 


Move the demos folder from within the lvgl folder to the src folder in the same directory.

NOTE: to get the touch working from the supplied sketch I have changed file pins_config.h

#define TP_INT 21 // previously -1
